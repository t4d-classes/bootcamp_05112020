# Exercise 3

1. Create an array of two car objects. Use the data from the table created earlier to populate the array. Copy and paste the data created earlier from your HTML code to populate the array in the JavaScript code.

2. Once the DOM is loaded and ready to go, use JavaScript code to dynamically populate the table rows of the car table. On the initial load, there should be no rows in the tbody, then when the DOM is ready, your JavaScript code should take the array and populate the table.

3. Style the table to look nice if you have not done so already.

4. Ensure it works!
