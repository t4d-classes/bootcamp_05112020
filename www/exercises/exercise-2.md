# Exercise 2

1. Create a new page named `car-tool.html`.

2. Set the section header to `Car Tool`.

3. Connect the new page to the main menu on the other pages.

4. Display a table of cars in the main content area. The table will have the following columns: id, make, model, year, color, and price. Display column headers for each column. Display 2 rows of car data. Not 1 row. Not 3 or more rows. Just 2 rows. And make sure you have all 6 columns. This code will be used later and possibly demoed to the whole class. Please have all 6 columns, and 2 rows of data.

5. Create a Car Form to collect new car data. Display input fields for make, model, year, color and price. Use a number type field for year and price.

6. Ensure it works.
